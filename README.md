# Income_Simulation

## Project background

In the delivery industry, ensuring efficient order distribution and balancing the income disparity among couriers are key concerns. Full-time couriers often have more availability or priority compared to part-time couriers, which can result in differences in income over time. This project aims to simulate a realistic delivery system in which couriers handle restaurant orders, allowing us to evaluate how these disparities develop.

The restaurant prices vary, affecting each courier's potential income, and the simulation provides insight into how different probabilities of securing orders impact cumulative earnings. The model simulates how income is distributed across a fleet of couriers over thousands of rounds, enabling an analysis of how different strategies for order allocation and courier participation might influence both efficiency and equity in income distribution.

## description
This project simulates income distribution for couriers working at restaurants. Couriers are divided into two groups: full-time and part-time. Full-time couriers have double the chance of securing an order compared to part-time couriers, reflecting their higher availability or priority in the system. The restaurants have varying order prices, and over time, the simulation tracks the total earnings of each courier.

-- Full-time couriers have a higher chance of securing orders (twice the chance of part-time couriers).

-- Different restaurants offer varying order values, influencing total earnings.

-- The simulation tracks income distribution over a long period, displaying both the short-term and long-term impacts on courier earnings.
